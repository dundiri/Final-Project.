# Proiect-Practic-Testare-Manuala
The scope of the final project for ITF Manual Testing Course is to use all gained knowledge throught the course and aplly them in practice, using a live application

Application under test: [Product Store](https://www.demoblaze.com/)



Tools used:JIRA, Zephyr Squad

**Functional specifications**

____

**Testing section**

**1.1 Test Planning**

The Test Plan is designed to describe all details of testing for the **Shopping experience** module from the ***Product Store***.

The plan identifies the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the types of testing to be performed, the personnel responsible for testing, the resources and schedule required to complete testing, and the risks associated with the plan

**1.1.1 Roles assigned to the project and persons allocated**

- Project manager - Letitia Mark
- Product owner - Oana Damian
- Software developer - Pop Vasile
- QA Engineer - Adelina Lumperdean

**1.1.2 Entry criteria defined**

- functional specifications are defined

- roles needed for the project are allocated

- initial project risks were detected and mitigated

**1.1.3 Exit criteria defined**

- all website features and functionalities work without critical errors.
- all links and navigation menus are functional and lead to the intended pages.
- all text and multimedia content are reviewed and free of grammatical errors.
- images and multimedia assets are properly compressed and optimized for web use.

**1.1.4 Test scope**
 - **Tests in scope:**
 All the feature of Dependents module which were defined in software requirement specs need to be tested: functional testing and GUI testing.

 - **Tests not in scope:**
   Performance testing, compatibility testing with multiple browsers and load testing.

**1.1.5 Risks detected:**
 - Projects risks:
   
   Insufficient or misallocation of resources (including personnel, equipment, or materials) can impede project progress.
   
   Lack of experience.
 - Product risks:
   
	The web page pagination could be impacted when opened on mobile devices with different versions of systems or rooted.

	User data (transactions) might be impacted with update tests.

	Stability risks (crashes, disconnects, etc).

**1.1.6 Evaluating entry criteria**
The entry criterias defined in the Test Planning phase have been achieved and the test process can continue.


**1.2 Test Monitoring and Control**

It will be done by generating periodic reports that reflect the current status of the test.

**1.3 Test Analysis**

The testing process will be executed based on the above requirements for the ***Shopping experience***. The following test conditions were found:

**1.4 Test Design**

Functional test cases were created in Zephyr Squad. Based on the analysis of the specifications, the test design techniques used for generating test cases are: 

The test cases with steps can be viewed here: [test_cases.pdf]()

**1.5 Test Implementation**

The following elements are needed to be ready before the test execution phase begins:

 - internet connection
 - all the hardware necessary
  
**1.6 Test Execution**

 - Test cases are executed on the created test Cycle summary(or Test Run): [cycle_summary_execution.pdf]()
 - Bugs have been created based on the failed tests. The complete bug reports can be found here: [created_bugs.pdf]()
